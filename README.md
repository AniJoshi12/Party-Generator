# Abstract
In this paper , I am going to design Parity Generator or checker using CMOS technology and MOSFETs are implemented using 28nm technology. Conventionally to 
design xor gate it requires 8 transistors which takes more area, consumes more power and delay is also more. So here I am designing xor with the help of 
2 transistors only which leads to decrease area , power consumption and delay.
